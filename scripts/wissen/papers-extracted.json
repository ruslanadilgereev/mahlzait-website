    "abstract": "More than 40% of adults in the United States have obesity, which is an independent risk factor for cardiometabolic\ndysfunction and several chronic diseases, including atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes\nmellitus. Interventions for obesity include lifestyle modification, pharmacotherapy, and metabolic surgery.\nLifestyle interventions have minimal side effects and are the most economical, yet long-term adherence is poor.\nChallenges for long-term adherence are related, in part, to metabolic adaptations that occur during weight loss\nthat affect appetite and energy expenditure. However, a lifestyle intervention that involves higher intakes of\nprotein and fiber and increased participation in exercise may help to blunt the increases in hunger and cravings\nthat occur with weight loss while increasing energy expenditure, thus assisting with both weight loss and weight\nloss maintenance. These changes also promote improved cardiometabolic health, independent of weight loss.\nThis narrative review summarizes the evidence for the roles of increasing protein, fiber, and exercise for weight\nmanagement and improving the cardiometabolic risk factor profile.",

Being overweight or obese\nis associated with a number of chronic diseases such as\ntype 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hyperten-\nsion [2, 3]. There is also an association with increased\nrisk of several cancers [4] including postmenopausal\nbreast [5] and prostate [6] among those who are over-\nweight or obese. Research has shown that even a small\nweight loss of 5 % of total body mass can reduce\nchronic disease burden for overweight and obese\nindividuals [7].\nThere are many weight loss programs that have\nbeen developed and delivered via internet and other\nweb-based platforms [8, 9] as well as through social\nmedia [10] to promote weight loss and reduce risk of\nchronic disease. Participant engagement with social\nmedia in the context of a weight loss intervention\nhas been shown to be related to weight loss (e.g.,\nFacebook and Twitter) [10]; yet keeping people en-\ngaged in weight loss programs delivered via social\nmedia has been a challenge [11].

Additionally, alternate day fasting\nshowed a trivial reduction in body weight compared\nwith both time restricted eating and whole day\nfasting (mean difference −1.69 kg (−2.49 to −0.88)\nand −1.05 kg (−1.90 to −0.19), respectively, both\nwith moderate certainty of evidence). Estimates\nwere similar among trials with less than 24 weeks\nfollow-up (n=76); however, moderate-to-long-term\ntrials (≥24 weeks, n=17) only showed benefits in\nweight reduction in diet strategies compared with\nad-libitum. Furthermore, in comparisons between\nintermittent fasting strategies, alternate day fasting\nlowered total cholesterol, triglycerides, and non-high\ndensity lipoprotein compared with time restricted\neating. Compared with whole day fasting, however,\ntime restricted eating resulted in a small increase in\ntotal cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol,\nand non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol.

Campbell\nContext: The impact of dietary protein on body composition changes after older\nadults purposefully lose weight requires systematic evaluation. Objective: This sys-\ntematic review and meta-analysis assessed the effects of protein intake (<25% vs\n\u001525% of energy intake or 1.0 g/kg/d) on energy restriction–induced changes in\nbody mass, lean mass, and fat mass in adults older than 50 years.

This study was a systematic review of peer-reviewed journal articles comparing fully\nautomated AI-based (e.g. deep learning) methods of dietary assessment from digital images to\nhuman assessors and ground truth (e.g. doubly labelled water).\nMaterials and Methods: Literature was searched through May 2023 in four electronic databases\nplus reference mining. Eligible articles reported AI estimated volume, energy, or nutrients.\nIndependent investigators screened articles and extracted data. Potential sources of bias were\ndocumented in absence of an applicable risk of bias assessment tool.\nResults: Database and hand searches identified 14,059 unique publications; fifty-two papers\n(studies) published from 2010 to 2023 were retained. For food detection and classification, 79%\nof papers used a convolutional neural network. Common ground truth sources were calculation\nusing nutrient tables (51%) and weighed food (27%). Included papers varied widely in food\nimage databases and results reported, so meta-analytic synthesis could not be conducted. Relative\nerrors were extracted or calculated from 69% of papers. Average overall relative errors (AI vs.\nground truth) ranged from 0.10% to 38.3% for calories and 0.09% to 33% for volume, suggesting\nsimilar performance. Ranges of relative error were lower when images had single/simple foods.\nConclusions: Relative errors for volume and calorie estimations suggest that AI methods align\nwith – and have the potential to exceed – accuracy of human estimations. However, variability in\nfood image databases and results reported prevented meta-analytic synthesis.

This study was a systematic review of peer-reviewed journal articles comparing fully\nautomated AI-based (e.g. deep learning) methods of dietary assessment from digital images to\nhuman assessors and ground truth (e.g. doubly labelled water).\nMaterials and Methods: Literature was searched through May 2023 in four electronic databases\nplus reference mining. Eligible articles reported AI estimated volume, energy, or nutrients.\nIndependent investigators screened articles and extracted data. Potential sources of bias were\ndocumented in absence of an applicable risk of bias assessment tool.\nResults: Database and hand searches identified 14,059 unique publications; fifty-two papers\n(studies) published from 2010 to 2023 were retained. For food detection and classification, 79%\nof papers used a convolutional neural network. Common ground truth sources were calculation\nusing nutrient tables (51%) and weighed food (27%). Included papers varied widely in food\nimage databases and results reported, so meta-analytic synthesis could not be conducted. Relative\nerrors were extracted or calculated from 69% of papers. Average overall relative errors (AI vs.\nground truth) ranged from 0.10% to 38.3% for calories and 0.09% to 33% for volume, suggesting\nsimilar performance. Ranges of relative error were lower when images had single/simple foods.\nConclusions: Relative errors for volume and calorie estimations suggest that AI methods align\nwith – and have the potential to exceed – accuracy of human estimations. However, variability in\nfood image databases and results reported prevented meta-analytic synthesis.

Schoeller, PhD\nIMPORTANCE Short sleep duration has been recognized as a risk factor for obesity. Whether\nextending sleep duration may mitigate this risk remains unknown.\nOBJECTIVE To determine the effects of a sleep extension intervention on objectively assessed\nenergy intake, energy expenditure, and body weight in real-life settings among adults with\noverweight who habitually curtailed their sleep duration.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This single-center, randomized clinical trial was\nconducted from November 1, 2014, to October 30, 2020. Participants were adults aged 21 to\n40 years with a body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in\nmeters squared) between 25.0 and 29.9 and had habitual sleep duration of less than 6.5\nhours per night. Data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle.\nINTERVENTIONS After a 2-week habitual sleep period at baseline, participants were\nrandomized to either an individualized sleep hygiene counseling session that was intended to\nextend their bedtime to 8.5 hours (sleep extension group) or to continue their habitual sleep\n(control group). All participants were instructed to continue daily routine activities at home\nwithout any prescribed diet or physical activity.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was change in energy intake from\nbaseline, which was objectively assessed as the sum of total energy expenditure and change\nin body energy stores. Total energy expenditure was measured by the doubly labeled water\nmethod. Change in body energy stores was computed using regression of daily home weights\nand body composition changes from dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Sleep duration was\nmonitored by actigraphy. Changes from baseline were compared between the 2 groups using\nintention-to-treat analysis.\nRESULTS Data from 80 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 29.8 [5.1] years; 41 men\n[51.3%]) were analyzed. Sleep duration was increased by approximately 1.2 hours per night\n(95% CI, 1.0 to 1.4 hours; P < .001) in the sleep extension group vs the control group. The\nsleep extension group had a significant decrease in energy intake compared with the control\ngroup (−270 kcal/d; 95% CI, −393 to −147 kcal/d; P < .001). The change in sleep duration was\ninve"

Fairly long-term clinical trials of 6–12 months\nreported that a high-protein diet (HPD) provides weight-loss effects and can prevent weight regain after weight\nloss. HPD has not been reported to have adverse effects on health in terms of bone density or renal function in\nhealthy adults. Among gut-derived hormones, glucagon-like peptide-1, cholecystokinin, and peptide tyrosine-\ntyrosine reduce appetite, while ghrelin enhances appetite. HPD increases these anorexigenic hormone levels\nwhile decreasing orexigenic hormone levels, resulting in increased satiety signaling and, eventually, reduced\nfood intake. Additionally, elevated diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT), increased blood amino acid concentra-\ntion, increased hepatic gluconeogenesis, and increased ketogenesis caused by higher dietary protein contribute\nto increased satiety. The mechanism by which HPD increases energy expenditure involves two aspects: first, pro-\nteins have a markedly higher DIT than carbohydrates and fats. Second, protein intake prevents a decrease in\nFFM, which helps maintain resting energy expenditure despite weight loss. In conclusion, HPD is an effective\nand safe tool for weight reduction that can prevent obesity and obesity-related diseases. However, long-term\nclinical trials spanning more than 12 months should be conducted to further substantiate HPD effects.\nKey words: High protein diet, Weight loss, Obesity, Satiation\nReceived April 1, 2020\nReviewed April 25, 2020\nAccepted May 19, 2020\n*Corresponding author\nGwanpyo Koh\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0002-6020-2777\nDepartment of Internal Medicine, Jeju\nNational University School of Medicine,\n102 Jejudaehang-ro, Jeju 54987, Korea\nTel: +82-64-754-8163\nFax: +82-64-717-1131\nE-mail: okdom@jejunu.ac.kr\nINTRODUCTION\nPrevalence of obesity around the world have increased rapidly in\nrecent years.

Similar proportions reached 5% weight loss at 6 months (43.2% in Standard\nand 42.9% in Simplified). There were no differences in number of dietary tracking days or change\nin average daily caloric intake between groups.\nConclusions: Two mobile-delivered weight loss interventions produced clinically meaningful\nlevels of weight loss at 6 months, with no differences in dietary tracking adherence or dietary\nintake. The results suggest that simplified monitoring of high-calorie foods could be a promising\nalternative to calorie monitoring.\nCorrespondence Brooke T.

    "abstract": "Obesity is a chronic disease that affects more than 650 million adults worldwide. Obesity not\nonly is a significant health concern on its own, but predisposes to cardiometabolic comorbidities,\nincluding coronary heart disease, dyslipidemia, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers.\nLifestyle interventions effectively promote weight loss of 5% to 10%, and pharmacological\nand surgical interventions even more, with some novel approved drugs inducing up to an\naverage of 25% weight loss. Yet, maintaining weight loss over the long-term remains extremely\nchallenging, and subsequent weight gain is typical. The mechanisms underlying weight regain\nremain to be fully elucidated. The purpose of this Pennington Biomedical Scientific Symposium\nwas to review and highlight the complex interplay between the physiological, behavioral, and\nenvironmental systems controlling energy intake and expenditure. Each of these contributions\nwere further discussed in the context of weight-loss maintenance, and systems-level viewpoints\nwere highlighted to interpret gaps in current approaches. The invited speakers built upon the\nscience of obesity and weight loss to collectively propose future research directions that will aid in\nrevealing the complicated mechanisms involved in the weight-reduced state.",

    "abstract": "Background: Time-restricted eating (TRE), without calorie counting, has become a popular\nweight loss strategy, yet long-term randomized trials evaluating its efficacy are limited.\nObjective: To determine whether TRE is more effective for weight control and cardiometabolic\nrisk reduction compared with calorie restriction (CR) or control.\nDesign: 12-month randomized controlled trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04692532)\nSetting: University of Illinois Chicago from January 2021 to September 2022.\nParticipants: 90 adults with obesity.\nIntervention: 8-hour TRE (eating between noon and 8:00 p.m. only, without calorie counting),\nCR (25% energy restriction daily), or control (eating over a period of 10 or more hours per day).\nParticipants were not blinded.\nMeasurements: Change in body weight, metabolic markers, and energy intake by month 12.\nResults: Seventy-seven persons completed the study. Mean age was 40 years (SD, 11), 33% were\nBlack, and 46% were Hispanic. Mean reduction in energy intake was −425 kcal/d (SD, 531) for\nTRE and −405 kcal/d (SD, 712) for CR. Compared with the control group, weight loss by month\n12 was −4.61 kg (95% CI, −7.37 to −1.85 kg;\nP ≤ 0.01) (−4.87% [CI, −7.61% to −2.13%]) for the\nTRE group and −5.42 kg (CI, −9.13 to −1.71 kg;\nP ≤ 0.01) (−5.30% [CI, −9.06% to −1.54%]) for\nthe CR group, with no statistically significant difference between TRE and CR (0.81 kg [CI, −3.07\nto 4.69 kg;\nP = 0.68]) (0.43% [CI, −3.48% to 4.34%]).\nLimitation: Not blinded, not powered to detect relatively large differences in weight loss, and\nlack of adjustment for multiple comparisons.\nConclusion: Time-restricted eating is more effective in producing weight loss when compared\nwith control but not more effective than CR in a racially diverse population.\nTime-restricted eating (TRE) has become a popular weight loss regimen (1–3). The sudden\nincrease in popularity of TRE is mostly likely due to its sheer simplicity and the fact that\nit does not require persons to count calories to lose weight. Participants are simply asked\nto consume all food within a specified time frame and fast with energy-free beverages\nfor the remaining hours of the day. Evidence shows that when persons with obesity limit\ntheir eating window to 6 to 8 hours per day, they naturally reduce energy intake by 350 to\nLin et al. Page 2\nAnn Intern Med.

From a clinical standpoint, these findings are paramount. One of the\nmain reasons for participant attrition with traditional dieting–that is, daily calorie restriction\n(CR)–is frustration with having to count calories every day (6, 7). Time-restricted eating\nregimens can sidestep this requirement by allowing participants to simply “watch the clock”\ninstead of monitoring calories, while still producing weight loss and cardiometabolic health\nimprovements (8–10). This feature of TRE has the potential to improve long-term adherence\nto this eating plan, and in turn, produce lasting weight control in adults with obesity.\nHowever, few long-term trials have evaluated the efficacy of TRE for weight loss. In the\nstudy by Liu and colleagues (11), adults with obesity were randomly assigned to either early\nTRE (consuming all food between 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.) combined with intentional CR\nor CR alone. After 12 months, both groups lost a similar amount of weight (7% to 9%\nfrom baseline) (11). Although these findings are valuable to the field, the study is limited\nin that it did not examine how TRE alone–that is, without calorie counting–affects body\nweight. In addition, the real-life applicability of the study is questionable given that an early\neating window was used. Evidence from a recent large-scale observational study of nearly\n800 000 adults shows that Americans who engage in TRE place their eating window in the\nafternoon or evening so that they can continue to eat dinner with family and friends (12).\nMoreover, the generalizability of the findings is uncertain given that the trial was done solely\nin Chinese adults. Thus, it is unclear if these findings would be reproducible in a diverse\nAmerican population. Indeed, conventional nutrition strategies are often difficult to execute\nin historically marginalized communities because they require a high level of numeracy,\nliteracy, cost, and time to change the food composition in the home. All these factors limit\nthe ability of traditional CR protocols to support weight reduction in these high-risk cohorts.\nAccordingly, we conducted a 1-year randomized controlled trial to compare the effects of\nTRE (eating all food between noon and 8:00 p.m., without calorie counting) versus CR\n(25% energy restriction daily) and a control group eating over a period of 10 or more hours\nper day on body weight and cardiometabolic risk factors in a racially and ethnically diverse\ngroup of American adults with obesity.

The criteria used to define adherence to dietary self‐monitoring\nin obesity treatment tend to vary, particularly in studies that include dietary self‐\nmonitoring via mobile applications (apps). The objectives of this study were to (a)\ndetermine weight change outcomes related to app‐based dietary self‐monitoring\nand (b) determine the associations between the frequency, consistency, and\ncompleteness of dietary self‐monitoring and weight change.\nMethods: In this single‐arm uncontrolled prospective study, employees at a large,\nurban health system who had overweight or obesity self‐monitored dietary intake\nfor 8 weeks using the Calorie Counter by FatSecret app. A paired sample t‐test\nexamined the association of app‐based dietary self‐monitoring and weight change;\nlinear regression examined the associations of frequent, consistent, and complete\ndietary self‐monitoring and weight change.\nResults: A significant mean difference [t (89) = 6.59, p < 0.001] was found between\nbaseline and 8‐week weight (M = −1.5 � 2.1 kg) in the sample (N = 90). Linear\nregression revealed a significant association [F (1, 88) = 7.18, p = 0.009] between\ntotal weeks of consistent dietary self‐monitoring (M = 4.4 � 2.8) and percent weight\nloss (M = −1.54% � 2.26%), and a significant association [F (1, 88) = 6.42, p = 0.013]\nbetween dietary self‐monitoring frequency (M = 50.1% � 33.3%) and percent\nweight loss.

Adherence to\nDSM declines over time, however, and barriers to using a paper\ndiary include the tedious nature of self‐monitoring, diary\nmisplacement, manually writing DSM entries, and no immediate\nfeedback.2 DSM via mobile device applications (apps) is an\nappealing alternative to conventional self‐monitoring techniques.6\nAfter recording DSM data into an app, immediate feedback\nregarding calories, nutrient intake, and progress toward goal\nachievement is commonly provided.2 Most Americans (97%) own a\nmobile phone, and 85% own a smartphone capable of downloading\nhealth‐related apps.7\nA recent review found a positive relationship between self‐\nmonitoring via digital modes2; however, less is known about app‐\nbased DSM compared to the large body of knowledge on paper‐\nbased DSM,8 particularly the relationship between adherence to\nDSM and weight loss.9 The criteria used to define adherence to\nDSM in obesity treatment tend to vary.10 Adherence to app‐based\nDSM has been operationally defined in weight loss interventions as\na specific recorded amount of calorie intake, the frequency of\nDSM, or combinations of both.11 For example, the frequency,\nconsistency, and completeness of DSM are common indicators of\nadherence.3 Frequency has been defined as the total number of\ndays and percentage of days over the course of a study that\nparticipants were adherent to DSM,2,11‐16 while consistency has\nbeen defined as documenting ≥three daily DSM records per\nweek.3,4 Regarding completeness, individuals who recorded 50% or\nmore of their weekly calorie goal were considered adherent, while\nthose who recorded less than 50% of their goal were non‐\nadherent.17 Considering the lack of consensus on assessment of\nadherence,10,11 and that the DSM adherence criteria associated\nwith weight loss is unknown,9 studying multiple indicators18 of\nadherence to app‐based DSM, and their respective relationships\nwith weight loss is warranted.\nTo date, no st",

The criteria used to define adherence to dietary self‐monitoring\nin obesity treatment tend to vary, particularly in studies that include dietary self‐\nmonitoring via mobile applications (apps). The objectives of this study were to (a)\ndetermine weight change outcomes related to app‐based dietary self‐monitoring\nand (b) determine the associations between the frequency, consistency, and\ncompleteness of dietary self‐monitoring and weight change.\nMethods: In this single‐arm uncontrolled prospective study, employees at a large,\nurban health system who had overweight or obesity self‐monitored dietary intake\nfor 8 weeks using the Calorie Counter by FatSecret app. A paired sample t‐test\nexamined the association of app‐based dietary self‐monitoring and weight change;\nlinear regression examined the associations of frequent, consistent, and complete\ndietary self‐monitoring and weight change.\nResults: A significant mean difference [t (89) = 6.59, p < 0.001] was found between\nbaseline and 8‐week weight (M = −1.5 � 2.1 kg) in the sample (N = 90). Linear\nregression revealed a significant association [F (1, 88) = 7.18, p = 0.009] between\ntotal weeks of consistent dietary self‐monitoring (M = 4.4 � 2.8) and percent weight\nloss (M = −1.54% � 2.26%), and a significant association [F (1, 88) = 6.42, p = 0.013]\nbetween dietary self‐monitoring frequency (M = 50.1% � 33.3%) and percent\nweight loss.

Wing, PhD\nBackground: The challenge of weight-loss maintenance is well known, but few studies have\nfollowed successful weight losers over an extended period or evaluated the effect of behavior change\non weight trajectories.\nPurpose: To study the weight-loss trajectories of successful weight losers in the National Weight\nControl Registry (NWCR) over a 10-year period, and to evaluate the effect of behavior change on\nweight-loss trajectories.\nMethods: A 10-year observational study of self-reported weight loss and behavior change in 2886\nparticipants (78% female; mean age 48 years) in the NWCR who at entry had lost at least 30 lbs (13.6 kg)\nand kept it off for at least one year. Data were collected in 1993–2010; analysis was conducted in 2012.\nMain outcome measures: Weight loss (kilograms; percent weight loss from maximum weight).\nResults: Mean weight loss was 31.3 kg (95% CI¼30.8, 31.9) at baseline, 23.8 kg (95% CI¼23.2, 24.4)\nat 5 years and 23.1\u00010.4 kg (95% CI¼22.3, 23.9) at 10 years. More than 87% of participants were\nestimated to be still maintaining at least a 10% weight loss at Years 5 and 10. Larger initial weight losses\nand longer duration of maintenance were associated with better long-term outcomes. Decreases in\nleisure-time physical activity, dietary restraint, and frequency of self-weighing and increases in\npercentage of energy intake from fat and disinhibition were associated with greater weight regain.\nConclusions: The majority of weight lost by NWCR members is maintained over 10 years. Long-\nterm weight-loss maintenance is possible and requires sustained behavior change.\n(Am J Prev Med 2014;46(1):17–23) & 2014 American Journal of Preventive Medicine\nIntroduction\nT he problem of long-term weight-loss main-\ntenance is well known.1,2 Although initial\nweight losses of 5%–10% of body weight are\nachievable and prevent chronic diseases,3–6 concerns\nabout sustaining these weight losses have led some\nto question the wisdom of encouraging weight-loss\nefforts.7\nIt is often reported that most people who lose weight\nwill regain it within 5 years,8 but this conclusion is not\nalways supported by data. Using National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data, Weiss\nand colleagues reported that among 1300 adults who had\nlost 10% or more of their body weight, 58% maintained\nthis weight "
